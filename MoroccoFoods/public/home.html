                    The tajine is the traditional dish par excellence of Morocco. It must be said that this magic word is an evacuator of the flavors of the Maghreb, it is always an invitation to escape to travel. It takes its name well from the typical glazed earthenware utensil in which it is slowly cooked over charcoal.

                    There are endless varieties of tagines, including:

                    tajine with chicken, lemon and olives
                    fish tagine
                    sardine tagine
                    vegetable tagine.

                    Breads called khobz tajine are cooked on a plate also called "tagine".
                    The Moroccan tagine is a dish whose preparation container is called "tagine", it is also a terracotta serving container, topped with a conical lid, from Berber cuisine

            <!-- chermoula -->
            <div class="wrapper">
                <p class="info">
                    made with garlic, herbs, preserved lemons, olive oil, and cumin. The fish is seasoned and marinated with half of the sauce and then tossed with the remaining half before being baked or broiled. The rest can be used for another purpose, such as mixing into couscous or a salad. Although each country has its version of chermoula—and there are several variations—the taste is always very similar.

                    This healthy, aromatic dish is low in fat and carbs, but big on flavor. The best part is that this delicious dinner requires little clean up and can be on the table 30 minutes start to finish.

                    Really, chermoula works like a flavour bomb! It is a type of paste or marinade that is very common in North Africa and goes very well with fish, meat, poultry and vegetables. Pretty much with everything savoury.
